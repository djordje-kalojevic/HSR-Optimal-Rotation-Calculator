# HSR-Optimal-Rotation-Calculator
The HSR Optimal Rotation Calculator is a powerful tool for optimizing character rotations in Honkai: Star Rail. It offers features like calculating optimal rotations, support for various customization options, all via a user-friendly GUI.

It allows the user to calculate the following:

- Basic attack only rotation, and the required energy recharge (ER) for the next breakpoint.
- Skill only rotation, and the needed ER for the next breakpoint.
- One-skill rotation, perfect for checking if your rotation aligns with buff/debuff durations (e.g., Tingyun, SW, etc.).
- Shortest, most skill-positive rotation, i.e., it prioritizes rotations with the lowest skill point cost if multiple rotations are eligible.

This calculator supports various customization options, including character selection, their eidolons, abilities and talents, equipped Light Cones, and relics, as well as some team buffs. The results of the calculations are conveniently displayed in the terminal.

Future plans include adding new characters, missing abilities and eidolons, incorporating missing follow-up attacks and support Light Cones, and improving documentation for further development.

To access the HSR Optimal Rotation Calculator, you can either install it from this GitHub repository or use the already compiled executable. Your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are greatly appreciated!
